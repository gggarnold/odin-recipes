    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Banana bread is a type of bread made from mashed bananas.  It is often a moist, sweet; however there are some banana bread recipes that are yeast raised breads.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2⅓ cups mashed overripe bananas</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
